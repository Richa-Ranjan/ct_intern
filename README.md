- `/login` to generate a JSON Web Token
- Protected routes require a valid token
- **Objective**: Implement stateless auth

### ➤ Assignment 6: External API Integration
- Connect with third-party API (e.g., weather)
- Proxy API data in your own endpoint
- **Objective**: Learn API consumption & error handling

### ➤ Assignment 7: Middleware & Error Handling
- Centralized error handler
- Custom validation middleware
- Clean route separation

## 🚀 Getting Started

For each assignment:
1. `cd assignmentX`
2. `npm install`
3. `node index.js`
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or read the README in each folder for specifics)

## 📚 Tech Stack & Concepts

- **Node.js** & **Express.js** for servers & APIs  
- **Multer** for file uploads  
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose** for database handling  
- **JWT** for authentication  
- **Third-party APIs** for data integration  
- **Error handling**, middleware, and structured routes  
- **Vanilla HTML**, **CSS animations**, and **JavaScript** for frontend polish

## ✅ Why It Matters

Through these eight assignments, I’ve built a solid foundation in:

1. RESTful API creation & best practices  
2. Data persistence (file vs database)  
3. Secure endpoint design  
4. Integrating external services  
5. Creating clean, user-friendly interfaces  

This sets me up for more advanced full-stack development projects and collaborative team work.
